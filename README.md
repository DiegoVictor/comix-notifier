This application scrapes the [Comix Book Shop](http://www.comix.com.br) website, it finds the last volume of each mangÃ¡ configured in the database and it sends push notifications to the mobile application (inside `app` folder) through a topic to users that subscribed to it.

# Requirements
  * Node.js ^16.6.1
  * Serveless Framework
  * AWS Account
    * [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)
    * [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
    * [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda)
    * [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
    * [EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/)
  * Firebase Account
    * [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)

# Installing
Easy peasy lemon squeezy:
```
$ yarn
```
Or:
```
$ npm install
```
> Was installed and configured the [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) and [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) to keep the code clean and patterned.

## Configuring
The application sends and receives notifications (API and mobile application, respectively), to configure it properly you need to do some configurations.

* First, [create a project into Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#create-firebase-project), then download `google-services.json` file inside the `app` folder from the project configuration page (*General* Tab) and copy the API Cloud Messaging Token (or create one if not exists) from *Cloud Messaging* Tab.

* Access your AWS account, open the [SNS panel](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home) and [create a platform application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-register.html) with the following name `Comix-Notifier`, select `Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)` as the platform and paste the API Cloud Messaging Token that you copied previously.
> If you would like to use another name just remember to update the platform's ARN key in the `serverless.ts` (`custom.platformApplicationArn`).

Install the AWS Layers before to deploy:
```
$ cd layers/nodejs
$ npm install
```
Or:
```
$ cd layers/nodejs
$ yarn
```
Now you are ready to deploy the API, just run:
```
$ sls deploy
```

After the deploy concludes, configure the lambda's URL outputed by the deploy process into the [`.env`](#env) file.

### .env
Rename the `.env.example` in the `app` directory to `.env` and configure the URL for the subscription lambda, it should be outputed at the end of the deploy process.

|key|description|default
|---|---|---
|SUBSCRIPTION_URL|Subscription lambda URL.| -

# Usage
In order to be able to subscribe to the topic and start to receive push notifications you will need to:

* [Create an API Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-setup-api-key-with-console.html#api-gateway-usage-plan-create-apikey), then [create and configure a usage plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-usage-plans-with-console.html#api-gateway-usage-plan-create) to it. Copy the key, this will be necessary in the next steps and don't forget to associate the API's stage to the created plan! .

Install the mobile app, the first build must be through USB connection, so connect your device (or just open your emulator) and run:
```
$ cd app
$ yarn android
```
> For iOS use `ios` instead of `android`, but this app was tested only with Android through USB connection and [Android Studio Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds), is strongly recommended to use the same system.

In the next times you can just start the Metro Bundler server:
```
$ yarn start
```
Or:
```
$ npm run start
```

After install the app, follow the instructions on the screen.
> You'll use the API Key here.

## API Key
The `/subscribe` route expect an API Key in the `x-api-key` request header.
> You can see more about this route in the [routes](#routes) section.
```
POST https://kj1q0nigu8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/subscribe x-api-key: rJvz2XWV611PycVISNd2T43pCB4X1g5n7E8iyT58
```
> To get one API Key you need to [generate one in API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-setup-api-key-with-console.html#api-gateway-usage-plan-create-apikey).

## Routes
|route|HTTP Method|params|description|auth method
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
|`/subscribe`|POST|Body with device FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) `token`|Subscribe the device for push notifications.|[API Key](#api-key)

### Requests
* `POST /subscribe`

Request body:
```json
{
  "token": "ff7XgLfwSGaVFS05iayn58:APA91bEJ508hqz8hr2EZttm845wn9plsRdJTArMDukr4xTUwdKq_G9qYZCnRIi7lK0M5OeMrnws-DKNNd__TNvnOLmekSNNcBXg3I08oAxT_wksoONXJVz0S12joypaq0-w7IEY6q7Pc"
}
```

# Running the tests
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) was the choice to test the app, to run:
```
$ yarn test
```
Or:
```
$ npm run test
```
> Run the command in the root folder

## Coverage report
You can see the coverage report inside `tests/coverage`. They are automatically created after the tests run.
